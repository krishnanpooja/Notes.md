**Idea**
Using LLM API to build software applications

**Two type of LLMs**
1. Base LLM - Predict next word based on the text training data
exmaple: What is the capital of France?
  What is France's largest city?
  

2. Instruction Tuned LLM
- Tries to follow instructions
- Fine-tune of instructions and good attempts at following those instructions
example: What is the capital of France?
  - The capital of France is Paris.
  
  - Refined further using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback
