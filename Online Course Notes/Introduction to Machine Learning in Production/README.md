- Identify the key components of the ML Lifecycle.
- Define “concept drift” as it relates to ML projects.
- Differentiate between shadow, canary, and blue-green deployment scenarios in the context of varying degrees of automation.
- Compare and contrast the ML modeling iterative cycle with the cycle for deployment of ML products.
- List the typical metrics you might track to monitor concept drift.
