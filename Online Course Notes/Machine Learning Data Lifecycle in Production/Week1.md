### Learning Objectives
- Describe the differences between ML modeling and a production ML system
- Identify responsible data collection for building a fair production ML system
- Discuss data and concept change and how to address it by annotating new training data with direct labeling and/or human labeling
- Address training data issues by generating dataset statistics and creating, comparing and updating data schemas


## Collecting,labeling and validating data
ML development + Software development

Modern Software Development concepts applied in ML pipelines:
1. Scalabilty
2. Extensibilty - can you add new stuff?
3. Configuration
4. consistency and reproducibilty
5. safety and security
6. modularity
7. testabilty?
8. monitoring
9. best pratices

ML pipelines are directed acyclic graphs (DAGS) (graphs without any circles)
